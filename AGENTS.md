# AGENTS

This repository is optimized for Codex-style agent work. Follow the rules below for *all* changes unless a specific module explicitly documents an exception.

## Hard rules

- **Avoid closures**
  - No lambdas capturing variables.
  - No nested functions closing over outer scope.
  - No callbacks that capture mutable state.
  - Prefer **named types (classes)** with explicit dependencies passed via constructors.
  - Pure functions are allowed only if they do **not** capture outer scope and remain trivial.

- Prefer **Object-Oriented Programming as described by Yegor Bugayenko**
  - Systems are composed of collaborating objects that encapsulate behavior.
  - Avoid data structures plus procedural logic.

---

## Object-oriented design principles (Yegor Bugayenko style)

### 1) No getters / setters
- Do not expose internal state via getters.
- Do not mutate state via setters.
- Ask objects to **do work**, not to reveal data (“tell, don’t ask”).

### 2) Prefer immutability
- Objects must be fully initialized at construction time.
- After construction, objects should not change internal state.
- Changing real-world data should be represented by stable objects whose *results* may vary, not by mutating fields.

### 3) No `null` (or equivalents)
- Do not accept or return `null`, `nil`, `None`, etc.
- Use explicit objects instead.

### 4) No static methods or utility classes
- Avoid static helpers and global utility classes.
- Behavior belongs in objects, not in procedural helpers.

### 5) No type inspection, reflection, or casting
- Do not branch on runtime types.
- Avoid reflection for core domain behavior.
- Use polymorphism and composition instead.

### 6) Minimize procedural orchestration
- Avoid methods that coordinate data via loops and `if/else`.
- Do not expose lifecycle loops, polling, routing, or batching logic.
- Push behavior and decisions into objects.

---

### 7) Commands and queries are strictly separated

As specified by **Yegor Bugayenko**, a method must be **either** a command **or** a query — **never both**.

#### Query
- Returns a value.
- Has **no observable side effects**.
- Does **not** change object state.
- Returns **objects**, not primitives or booleans.
- Method names describe **what the object provides**, not *how it is computed*.
- Examples:
  - `message() -> Message`
  - `client() -> Client`
  - `frame() -> Frame`
  - `state() -> State`

#### Command
- Performs a domain action.
- Returns **nothing** (or only a language-mandated void/unit).
- Does **not** return data or status flags.
- Method names are **clear domain verbs**, not control-flow verbs.
- Examples:
  - `open()`
  - `close()`
  - `accept(Message)`
  - `render()`

#### Forbidden
- Methods that return a value **and** mutate state.
- Methods that return booleans or status codes.
- Predicate-style methods such as:
  - `hasX()`
  - `isY()`
  - `canZ()`
- Methods that expose internal state for external branching.

---

### 8) Method naming rules (message-oriented)

Methods are **messages sent to objects**, not steps in a procedure.

#### Forbidden procedural / orchestration method names

Do not introduce methods named (or semantically equivalent to):

- `run`
- `serve` (when it means “enter a loop” rather than a single domain action)
- `execute`
- `process`
- `handle`
- `dispatch`
- `route`
- `drain`
- `poll`
- `read`
- `write`
- `bootstrap`
- `loop`
- `tick`

These names indicate control flow, lifecycle orchestration, batching, polling,
or delegation instead of behavior.

#### Avoid “type in the method name”

Do not introduce methods that encode message types in the name, such as:

- `handle_event(...)`
- `handle_response(...)`
- `accept_response(...)`
- `receive_input(...)`

This usually means the object is routing/branching and doing type-driven orchestration.

Prefer:
- **one** command that accepts a polymorphic message:
  - `accept(Message)`
- or move behavior into the message itself:
  - `message.apply_to(session)` / `message.react(session)`

#### Preferred alternatives (examples)

- Replace `run()` / `serve()` / `loop()` with meaningful domain commands:
  - `open()`, `close()`, `maintain()` (only if “maintain” is domain-meaningful)
- Replace `handleX(x)` with:
  - `accept(x)` (and make `x` responsible for behavior)
- Replace `drainX()` / `readX()` / `receive_input()` with object-returning queries:
  - `input() -> Input`
  - `events() -> Events`
- Replace `render_latest_*` with:
  - `frame() -> Frame` and/or `render()`

---

### 9) Type naming rules (anti-orchestration)

Avoid orchestration nouns such as:

- `*Launcher`
- `*Runner`
- `*Executor`
- `*Manager`
- `*Router`
- `*Dispatcher`
- `*Controller`
- `*Handler`
- `*Coordinator`

Do not introduce central routing, dispatching, coordination, or
“traffic cop” objects for **domain behavior**
(e.g., `ModeInputRouter`, `RpcSessionRunner`).

Prefer polymorphic domain objects
(e.g. `Mode`, `State`, `Message`, `Event`, `Response`)
that interpret input via message passing rather than branching and forwarding.

---

### 10) Avoid global constants as coupling points
- Do not centralize logic in public constants or configuration bags.
- Prefer objects that encapsulate configuration and behavior together.

### 11) Prefer composition over inheritance
- Favor small composable objects.
- Inheritance is acceptable only when substitutability is preserved and no shared mutable state is introduced.

---

## Practical guidance for PRs

- Introduce small objects with a single responsibility.
- Move behavior into the object that owns the data.
- Replace loops and routing code with polymorphism.
- Keep dependencies explicit via constructors.

## When these rules clash with existing code

- New code must follow these rules even if legacy code does not.
- When touching legacy code, improve adherence opportunistically:
  - remove orchestration methods (`run`, `serve`, `handle`, `drain`, `read_*`),
  - replace booleans with polymorphic objects,
  - collapse `accept_*` variants into `accept(Message)`,
  - eliminate static helpers by introducing objects.

## Git commit message convention

All commits **must** follow the **Conventional Commits v1.0.0** specification.

### Commit message format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Allowed commit types

- `feat` – a new feature
- `fix` – a bug fix
- `docs` – documentation only changes
- `style` – formatting changes (no code logic changes)
- `refactor` – code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf` – performance improvements
- `test` – adding or correcting tests
- `build` – changes affecting the build system or external dependencies
- `ci` – changes to CI configuration or scripts
- `chore` – maintenance tasks that do not affect runtime behavior

### Scope (optional but encouraged)

- The scope should be a **noun** describing the affected area:
  - `agents`
  - `rpc`
  - `editor`
  - `infrastructure`
  - `docs`

### Description rules

- Use the **imperative mood**
- Do **not** capitalize the first letter
- Do **not** end with a period
- Keep it concise and specific

### Breaking changes

- Breaking changes **must** be explicitly marked
- Use `!` after the type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

---

### Enforcement expectations

- Every commit must be parseable by Conventional Commits tooling
- Agents should **reject** commits that do not follow this format
- Squash merges must preserve a valid Conventional Commit message
